1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

<p>If I would have had time, for hotel and channel amount scalability, I would have added at least hotel and channel name search (did it in backend already) and pagination and perhaps the ability to filter the table based on visibility. I also had to leave error handling out</p>

<p>Took me around 14 hours of which over half was spent trying to figure out stuff I haven't used in years (MongoDB) or ever (React-Aria, Tailwind CSS, Google Cloud Functions)</p>
